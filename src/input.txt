"My name is Shakespeare Michael. I am 59 years old, and after many years of struggling
and wandering through time, I have finally succeeded in obtaining a National ID, a
significant achievement that grants me citizenship in this strange world I find myself in.
My ID number is 16404230198234, which marks my official entry into this era. In this
new land, I have befriended several people who have assisted me in adapting to the
modern world. One of my friends helped me create an email address:
shekspear59@gmail.com. Although I was unfamiliar with such a concept, it took me
some time to learn how to use it. Even more baffling, I had to pay 50 Euro to use this
email service! I learned that I had to send this payment through something called a bank
account. What a peculiar world this is! The people here do not trade money directly for
goods and services. Instead, they use machines that accept money and store them in
buildings called banks. For example, I used a bank called HBSC, which is a strange
name, but apparently it holds the power to manage my finances. I now have an account
number: 90987657483929124, which is used to define my wealth in this new world. I
have come to appreciate many things about the future, and it all feels so thrilling.
However, the most perplexing part is how people have become so reliant on machines.
They no longer carry coins and paper currency; instead, everything is done
electronically. If I need to contact anyone, I must use a phone number, which is yet
another strange concept. My personal number is 01252225398, so feel free to call if you
wish to speak to me. Life in this time is full of wonder, but it is also incredibly complex.
Technology and systems are unlike anything I ever imagined during my days as a
playwright, yet I am excited to explore more and adapt to this world of endless
possibilities."
